A java logger made mainly for minecraft mods that I've made as I've used this logger multiple times and I do not like the java syntaxing for logs as it is very long and can get very complicated and very annoying to remove the unnescessary stuff repeatedly since the timestamps are different, make a pull request or an issue request if you want the module to be more malleable or customizable!
